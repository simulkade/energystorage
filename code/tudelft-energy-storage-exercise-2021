    "## Introduction\n",
    "One solution for the mitigation of the large amount of CO$_2$ emission that is emitted due to human activity is to capture the produced CO$_2$ from the point sources, transporting it to a storage site, and storing it in the subsurface or in the oceans for a long time. The objective of this exercise is to help the students to calculate the minimum energy that is required to fulfill a CCS operation and the energy requirement with the state of the art technology.\n",

    "## Carbon dioxide capture\n",
    "Theoretically, a mixture of gases at a low pressure $p_0$, that is low enough to cause the gas behave ideally, can be separated using a set of semipermeable membranes without any change of enthalpy. The separated gases will be at their partial pressure $p_i = x_i p_0$ where $x_i$ is the molar composition of component $i$. However, to pressurize each separated gas to the same pressure $p_0$ from its partial pressure, the gas must be compressed at isothermal condition which requires the following amount of work:\n",
    "$$ w_i = R T_0 \\ln x_i$$\n",
    "The negative sign of $w_i$ denotes the work that is done on the system. For a typical flue gas mixture, the concentration of CO$_2$ is 0.15 and in the atmosphere it is 4$\\times 10^{-4}$. Therefore, the minimum work required for the separation of carbon dioxide can be calculated by:"

    "## Transport\n",
    "The transport of CO$_2$ are done via pipelines (in supercritical state) or by containers (in liquid state). For the pipeline transportation (sometimes in liquid phase), a specific pressure drop of $\\Delta p_s$ = 0.1 to 0.3 bar per kilometere of pipe is reported that leads to an economic transport (although an expensive pipeline). Assuming a 300 km pipeline for the transport of CO$_2$ in the Netherlands, we can calculate the pressure drop across the pipeline. This pressure drop needs to be compenstated for in a compressor station. The minimum work for isothermal compression can be calculated by\n",
