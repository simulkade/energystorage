# Subsurface Energy Storage
Material for the Subsurface Energy and Fluid Storage and Extraction (SEFSE) at DTU
The final project of the course is to design subsurface storage and extraction process to address the intermittency of the wind and solar energy as the main source of energy of the inhabitants of the imaginary Paradise Island:
