# Subsurface Energy Storage
Material for the Subsurface Energy and Fluid Storage and Extraction (SEFSE) at DTU
The final project of the course is to design subsurface storage and extraction process to address the intermittency of the wind and solar energy as the main source of energy of the inhabitants of the imaginary Paradise Island:

## Thanks
* [thermo](https://github.com/CalebBell/thermo) by [Caleb Bell](https://github.com/CalebBell) and other contributors; I have not used it yet but soon will, because CoolProp does not have the enthalpy of formation in its database.
